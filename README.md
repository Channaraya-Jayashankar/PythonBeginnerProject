# BMI Calculator üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Overview
This is a simple Python-based **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** that demonstrates my ability to handle user input, perform calculations, and manage conditional logic efficiently. The project is a great showcase of fundamental Python programming skills, including working with variables, mathematical operations, and conditionals, all while delivering a real-world application.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to enter their name, weight (in pounds), and height (in inches).
- **BMI Calculation**: Uses the BMI formula:
  \[
  BMI = (weight * 703) / (height^2)
  \]
- **Health Categorization**: Determines and displays the user's BMI category:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
  - Severely Obese
  - Morbidly Obese
- **Error Handling**: Includes validation for proper input and displays appropriate messages for incorrect entries.

## Code Breakdown
- **User Input**: The user provides their weight in pounds and height in inches, which is then converted to integers for calculation.
- **BMI Calculation**: The formula calculates the user's BMI based on their input.
- **BMI Categorization**: The program uses `if-elif-else` statements to determine which BMI category the user falls into, ensuring a personalized message.
- **Formatted Output**: Results are printed with the BMI value rounded to two decimal places for better readability.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Fundamentals**: Showcasing the ability to use basic Python syntax for input/output, calculations, and conditionals.
- **Mathematical Computation**: Implementing formulas to generate meaningful results.
- **String Formatting**: Using formatted strings (`f-strings`) for clean and readable output.
- **Conditional Logic**: Managing multiple conditions to provide appropriate health categorizations.
- **Error Handling**: Including a check for valid input to ensure the program behaves correctly.

## Future Enhancements
- Add unit conversion for metric inputs (kg and meters).
- Create a GUI version using **Tkinter** for a more user-friendly interface.
- Implement logging for tracking multiple user entries.

## Conclusion
This project highlights essential Python skills in a simple, easy-to-understand application. It is a great example of how I can solve real-world problems using Python and can be extended to more complex projects.
